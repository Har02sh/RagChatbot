    "text": "10 BIOLOGY Since the dawn of civilisation, there have been many attempts to classify living organisms. It was done instinctively not using criteria that were scientific but borne out of a need to use organisms for our own use - for food, shelter and clothing. Aristotle was the earliest to attempt a morescientific basis for classification. He used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups, those which had red blood and those that did not. In Linnaeus' time a Two Kingdom system of classification with Plantae and Animalia kingdoms was developed that included all plants and animals respectively. This system did not distinguish betweenthe eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi) organisms.",

Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easilydone and was easy to understand, but, a large number of organisms did not fall into either category. Hence the two kingdom classification used for a long time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphologya need was also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure, nature of wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction, evolutionary relationships, etc. Classification systems for the livingorganisms have hence, undergone several changes over the time.",

They often form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of these organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen inspecialised cells called heterocysts, e.g., Nostoc and Anabaena . Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria oxidise various inorganic substances such asnitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released energy for their ATP production. They play a great role in recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous,iron and sulphur. Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in nature. The majority are important decomposers.

The mycelium is aseptateand coenocytic. Asexual reproduction takes place byzoospores (motile) or by aplanospores (non-motile). These spores are endogenously produced in sporangium. A zygospore is formed by fusion of two gametes. Thesegametes are similar in morphology (isogamous) ordissimilar (anisogamous or oogamous).

Linnaeus later classified all living organismsinto two kingdoms - Plantae and Animalia. Whittaker proposed an elaborate five kingdom classification - Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia. The main criteria of the five kingdom classification were cell structure, body organisation,mode of nutrition and reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships. In the five kingdom classification, bacteria are included in Kingdom Monera. Bacteria are cosmopolitan in distribution. These organisms show the most extensivemetabolic diversity.",
